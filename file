Values starting with a caret `^` are treated as regular
expressions. `^foo/(bar|baz)` would match the projects
`foo/bar`, and `foo/baz`. Regular expressions have to fully
match the project name. So the above example would not match
`foo/bar2`, while `^foo/(bar|baz).*` would.

Values starting with a caret `^` are treated as regular
expressions. `^foo/(bar|baz)` would match the projects
`foo/bar`, and `foo/baz`. Regular expressions have to fully
match the project name. So the above example would not match
`foo/bar2`, while `^foo/(bar|baz).*` would.

Projects may be excluded from replication by using a regular
expression with inverse match. `^(?:(?!PATTERN).)*$` will
exclude any project that matches.

Values that are not regular expressions and end in `*` are
treated as wildcard matches. Wildcards match projects whose
name agrees from the beginning until the trailing `*`. So
`foo/b*` would match the projects `foo/b`, `foo/bar`, and
`foo/baz`, but neither `foobar`, nor `bar/foo/baz`.

Values that are neither regular expressions nor wildcards are
treated as single project matches. So `foo/bar` matches only
the project `foo/bar`, but no other project.

By default, replicates without matching, i.e. replicates
everything to all remotes.
